This Repo provides combination of ejs, Mongoose, Express.
Form these I created a Random Data Generetor Express app which will console.log the Random Data in console.
In ejs document it appears a Generate Now button, While clicking the Button, the main.js will get the request {/generate} which will store and generate Random Data into Employee Collection.
